# Pentago
A GUI For the Well-Known Game of Pentago

# Usage
- either run the executable jar file
- or... compile the java files (javac *.java)
- run Pentago.java (java Pentago)
- This game is auto-resizable. Stretch or shrink the screen whenever you wish!

# Rule Differences
- I coded this using Ofek's Rules for Pentago which I play with at home, so forgive me if they are different than what you are used to
- Difference 1: You are not required to rotate the board on your turn
- Difference 2: You are not allowed to rotate something the opposite direction of what your opponent did last turn. This is to prevent loops

# Button Overview
- Vanish Button: Does not display arrows that aren't editable
- Replay Button: Shows an Animation of any action a player did in the game (placed a piece, turned the board) to 'replay' the game
- New Game: What it says on the tin
- Next: Ends your turn (You can also just hit 'Enter' on your keyboard)
- Undo/Redo: Self-Explainable
